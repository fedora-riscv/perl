%description
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting.  Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.  A large
proportion of the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl.  You need the
perl package installed on your system so that your system can handle Perl
scripts.

Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your system to
handle Perl scripts.

%description Log-Message
Log::Message is a generic message storage mechanism. It allows you to store
messages on a stack -- either shared or private -- and assign meta-data to it.
Some meta-data will automatically be added for you, like a timestamp and a
stack trace, but some can be filled in by the user, like a tag by which to
identify it or group it, and a level at which to handle the message (for
example, log it, or die with it).

Requires:       perl = %{perl_epoch}:%{perl_version}-%{release}
BuildArch:      noarch

%description Module-Build
Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl modules.
It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Developers may alter
the behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more straightforward
way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require a make on your system - most
of the Module::Build code is pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform
way. In fact, you don't even need a shell, so even platforms like MacOS
(traditional) can use it fairly easily. Its only prerequisites are modules that
are included with perl 5.6.0, and it works fine on perl 5.005 if you can
install a few additional modules.

%description Module-CoreList
Module::CoreList contains the hash of hashes %Module::CoreList::version, this
is keyed on perl version as indicated in $].  The second level hash is module
=> version pairs.


%package Module-Load

either a file or a module.

%description Module-Loaded
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided by
external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these external
modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by perl, this module
offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded and/or unloaded.


%package Module-Pluggable

a question and then validate the reply, informing the user if the answer was not
proper and re-issuing the question.

Version:        1.15
Requires:       perl = %{perl_epoch}:%{perl_version}-%{release}

%description Time-Piece
The Time::Piece module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions
with implementations that return objects.  It does so in a backwards compatible
manner, so that using localtime or gmtime as documented in perlfunc still
behave as expected.


%package parent
Summary:        Establish an ISA relationship with base classes at compile time
Group:          Development/Libraries
License:        GPL+ or Artistic
# Epoch bump for clean upgrade over old standalone package
Epoch:          1
Version:        0.223
Requires:       perl = %{perl_epoch}:%{perl_version}-%{release}
BuildArch:      noarch

%description parent
parent allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up
inheritance from those modules at the same time. Mostly similar in effect to:

    package Baz;

    BEGIN {
        require Foo;
        require Bar; 
        
        push @ISA, qw(Foo Bar); 
    }


%package threads
Summary:        Perl interpreter-based threads
Group:          Development/Libraries
License:        GPL+ or Artistic
Epoch:          0
Version:        1.75
Requires:       perl = %{perl_epoch}:%{perl_version}-%{release}

%description threads
Since Perl 5.8, thread programming has been available using a model called
interpreter threads  which provides a new Perl interpreter for each thread,
and, by default, results in no data or state information being shared between
threads.

(Prior to Perl 5.8, 5005threads was available through the Thread.pm API. This
threading model has been deprecated, and was removed as of Perl 5.10.0.)

As just mentioned, all variables are, by default, thread local. To use shared
variables, you need to also load threads::shared.


%package threads-shared
Summary:        Perl extension for sharing data structures between threads
Group:          Development/Libraries
License:        GPL+ or Artistic
Epoch:          0
Version:        1.32
Requires:       perl = %{perl_epoch}:%{perl_version}-%{release}

%description threads-shared
By default, variables are private to each thread, and each newly created thread
gets a private copy of each existing variable. This module allows you to share
variables across different threads (and pseudo-forks on Win32). It is used
together with the threads module.  This module supports the sharing of the
following data types only: scalars and scalar refs, arrays and array refs, and
hashes and hash refs.
